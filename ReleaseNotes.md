## Release Notes

### v1.2.0

- A Scheduled Network Upgrade is Planned for October 6.

  Approximately on the 6th of October (Block #64000) there will be a scheduled network upgrade on the Zelerius network. To be sufficiently prepared, a user, or pool operator, should run daemon v1.2.0 or higher (walletd or zelriusd).

  The scheduled network upgrade introduces one major change. The maximum size of a block not resulting into penalty changes to 100000 bytes. Our goal is producing faster blocks on a shorter chain. This change helps to reduce the size of the chain.
